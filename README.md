Modifications on AngusC5 IOTDoorbell
These are changes I have made to the project https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-IoT-Doorbell/ by AngusC5
I have added some new functionality using additional files EG SMS.py will send a sms. This could be done in the IOYNotify.py file however I have done this seperately.
I have also made adjustments such as taking a video and storing this to the photos folder.
